For the player development I have been using animated characters that I have been developed using blender for a acdemical Project. After that I have been using capsules to make controls to give movements to player.
Then I have been using animations to make my character move like W= Move forward, S = Move backward, space bar = Jump etc. for each of that animations I have used animator for integrating the animations to movements of character with controls.
